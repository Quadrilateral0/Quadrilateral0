<!-- I am a licensed mental health clinician leveraging a background in healthcare management, compliance/QA, and clinical psychology. I am currently enrolled in Georgia Tech's Full Stack Coding certificate program to support a data management skill set with an emphasis on backend and database technologies.

I have a Master of Science in Clinical Psychology (USC) and I presently work in mental health compliance and quality assurance as a Licensing & Regulatory Compliance Manager for a mental health tech start-up. Prior to my current role, I served as Director of an addiction treatment facility.

Working in these fields has demonstrated the need for innovative assistive technologies in the health sector, and I am excited to knit together my interests in mental healthcare, compliance, and software engineering to create a better healthcare experience for all. -->
